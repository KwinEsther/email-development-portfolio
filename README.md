# Email Development Portfolio

Hey there, and welcome to my email development portfolio - a clean and organized space where I showcase the kind of email work I can bring to the table.

Inside this repo, you‚Äôll find professionally hand-coded email templates and signature designs. Clean HTML and inline CSS that ensure your emails look sharp, load fast, and display beautifully across all major email platforms.

## üìÅ What's Inside

### `email-signatures`
This folder contains custom-coded email signatures designed to help professionals and businesses stand out. Each signature is tailored for brand consistency, with clickable social icons, responsive layouts, and sharp rendering across platforms like Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, and others.

### `email-templates`
This is where you‚Äôll find full email templates for different use cases - think newsletters, promotional emails, onboarding emails, announcements, event invites, and more. Every template is designed to look great on mobile first (because that‚Äôs where most people check their inbox), and then scales seamlessly on tablets and desktops too.

## Why This Portfolio Exists

Emails are often the first impression - whether it‚Äôs a quick signature or a full-blown campaign. And if they don‚Äôt look right, they can hurt your brand more than help it.

That‚Äôs why I build emails that not only *look good* but *work well*. Consistent across different email clients, readable on any screen, and always on-brand.

This portfolio is a glimpse into what I bring to the table: attention to detail, thoughtful design, and clean code.

It showcases my ability to translate brand goals into functional, beautifully custom coded emails.
